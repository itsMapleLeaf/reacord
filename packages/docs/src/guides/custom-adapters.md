# Using Reacord with other libraries

Reacord's core is built to be library agnostic, and can be adapted to libraries other than Discord.js. However, Discord.js is the only built-in adapter at the moment, and the adapter API is still a work in progress.

If you're interested in creating a custom adapter, [see the code for the Discord.js adapter as an example](https://github.com/itsMapleLeaf/reacord/blob/main/packages/reacord/library/core/reacord-discord-js.ts). Feel free to [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/itsMapleLeaf/reacord/issues/new) if you run into issues.
